# Cryto-Power-BI-Project

This project is related to different crypto currency data like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin etc. showing its records of different years and predictions of future prices of different crypto currencies.

Here I have created custom column of year in power query editor.

The other Custom Column created is calculating average by adding HIGH and LOW VALUES in Power Query Editor.

There are two dashboards in the reports. Page 2 dashboard is duplicate of dashboard of Page 1. Page 2 dashboard is created duplicate because to toggle between different sheets with a Arrow sign and having the same data of Crypto Currency for the same year. Through the Crypto Currency and year will be the same as in Dashboard 1 but there will be different data which will tell High and Low values and Open and Close values data of the Crypto Currency of different days.

Dashboard 1:-

There are different SLICERS in the dashboard. These two slicers are arranged in HORIZONTAL Direction and the SYNC SLICERS are applied on it so that we can see both the slicers in both dashboard and toggle between them.

Year and Crypto Currency Slicers:-

NEXT is showing Market Cap of different days in a year. It is showing data of ETHEREUM IN Year 2018 with its Market Cap i.e. it is showing data of different days of the year 2018 and it is also showing data of 2019 year because it is predicting data of the year 2019 for " ETHEREUM " THROUGH FORECASTING. Predicting data of Ethereum in year 2019 i.e. predicting data of 365 days of 2019 year.
